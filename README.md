## Programs

### RR, RickRoll

This program plays the RickRoll song from YouTube over and over and over every second in your default browser.
**This is stoppable** if you are quick enough.

### SP, Spam

This program spams Windows CMD prompts open until memory fills up.

**You can not stop it after it starts** unless you have it on a USB stick that you can pull out.

## Usage/Naming Scheme

**A program will have a two part naming scheme, the first part being ether OP or RN:**

OP means open, it has some text and a 5 second timer at the end

RN means run, it is the actual program

The second part being what the programs short name is.
